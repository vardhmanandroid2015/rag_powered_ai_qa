üß† Intelligent Features You Can Add
	1. Memory of Uploaded PDFs per Session
		Store uploaded PDFs per session in a temporary namespace.
		Let users ask follow-up questions without re-uploading.
		Use uuid or timestamp to create a per-session PINECONE_NAMESPACE.

		‚û°Ô∏è Why? Reduces repeated embedding costs, enables dynamic sessions.

	2. PDF Summary on Upload
		Generate a short summary of the document using Gemini immediately after upload.

		python
		Copy
		Edit
		summary_prompt = f"Summarize the following document in 5 bullet points:\n\n{chunked_text[:1500]}"
		response = llm.invoke(summary_prompt)
		‚û°Ô∏è Why? Gives users a quick overview before they ask questions.

	3. Context Preview Panel
		Display the top chunks retrieved from Pinecone before generating the final Gemini answer.

		‚û°Ô∏è Why? Helps users verify that the AI is basing its answers on relevant parts of the PDF.

	4. Citation Mode
		Return context chunks alongside the answer.

		Highlight which chunk was used for which part of the answer (like a mini reference system).

		‚û°Ô∏è Why? Adds transparency and builds trust in the AI‚Äôs response.

	5. Multi-PDF Upload and Merging
		Allow multiple PDFs to be uploaded and merged into a single context window.

		‚û°Ô∏è Use Case: Compare regulatory guidelines across countries or summarize multiple documents together.

	6. Document Type Detection
		Use simple ML/NLP heuristics or regex to detect:
			Invoices
			Contracts
			Legal Notices
			Research Papers
			And tailor the prompt accordingly:
			if "research paper" in doc_type:
				prompt = "Answer like a scientific reviewer..."

	7. Natural Language Query Rewriting
		Run the user‚Äôs question through Gemini first to:

		Rephrase vague or short queries into more precise ones

		Add context like "according to the uploaded PDF"

	8. PDF Chunk Tagging
		Auto-tag chunks with semantic topics (e.g., "billing", "terms", "exceptions") during embedding and filter results by topic if needed.

	9. Ask in Multiple Languages
		Enable multilingual support by:
		Detecting input language
		Translating input and output using Gemini or Google Translate API
	
	10. Export Q&A Session as PDF or JSON
		Let users download the conversation or summary.
