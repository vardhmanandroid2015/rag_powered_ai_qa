Question,Answer,Topic
"What is the CAP theorem?","The CAP theorem states that a distributed database system can't simultaneously guarantee consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. It can only guarantee two out of the three.","Database Concepts"
"Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.","SQL databases are relational, use structured query language, have a fixed schema, and are typically vertically scalable. NoSQL databases are non-relational, have dynamic schemas, horizontal scalability, and different data models like document, key-value, wide-column, or graph.","Database Concepts"
"What is horizontal scaling?","Horizontal scaling (scaling out) means adding more machines or nodes to your system to handle increased load. This is common in distributed systems and NoSQL databases.","Scalability"
"What is vertical scaling?","Vertical scaling (scaling up) means increasing the resources (CPU, RAM, storage) of an existing machine or node. This is simpler but has limits and can lead to single points of failure.","Scalability"
"What is a load balancer and why is it used?","A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers. It's used to improve application availability, reliability, and scalability by preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck.","Networking"
"Describe different load balancing algorithms.","Common algorithms include Round Robin (distribute requests sequentially), Least Connections (send to server with fewest active connections), IP Hash (send requests from same IP to same server), and Weighted Load Balancing (distribute based on server capacity weights).","Networking"
"What is caching and its benefits?","Caching is storing copies of data in a temporary storage location (cache) so that subsequent requests for the same data can be served faster than retrieving from the original source. Benefits include reduced latency, lower database load, and improved throughput.","Caching"
"Explain the concept of eventual consistency.","Eventual consistency is a consistency model in distributed systems where, if no new updates are made to a given data item, all accesses to that item will eventually return the last updated value. It allows for higher availability and partition tolerance.","Consistency Models"
"What are microservices?","Microservices are an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services, modeled around a business domain. Each service is independently deployable, scalable, and often managed by a small team.","Architecture Styles"
"Why use a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?","A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content. They cache static assets (images, CSS, JS) closer to users, reducing latency and server load.","Networking"
