('How do different database implementations handle the CAP theorem', 'Different databases prioritize different aspects. Traditional RDBMS typically favor C and P. NoSQL databases like Cassandra (AP) or MongoDB (can be configured for AP or CP) make different trade-offs.'),
('What are the trade-offs when choosing between consistency and availability in a distributed system', 'Choosing Consistency means reads always return the most recent write, but the system might become unavailable during a network partition if nodes cannot agree on the consistent state.

('How does the CAP theorem influence the design of e-commerce platforms', 'E-commerce often needs high availability (customers can always browse/buy). Consistency is crucial for inventory and payment processing. Designers balance these; e.g., browsing might be AP (showing slightly stale stock), while checkout must be CP.'),
('Can you explain how YouTube handles the CAP theorem in its system design', 'YouTube likely prioritizes availability (AP) for video playback (users can always watch, even if view counts are slightly delayed).

('How do different isolation levels affect the performance of ACID transactions', 'Lower isolation levels (like Read Uncommitted) offer higher performance but risk more concurrency issues. Higher isolation levels (like Serializable) offer strong consistency guarantees but can reduce concurrency and performance due to more restrictive locking.'),
('What techniques are used to achieve isolation in ACID transactions', 'Common techniques include locking (preventing access to data being modified by another transaction) and Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), where each transaction sees a snapshot of the database, and changes create new versions of data rather than overwriting in place.'),
('How does locking mechanism contribute to isolation in ACID transactions', 'Locking prevents concurrent transactions from interfering by acquiring locks on data. A transaction must acquire a lock (e.g., read lock or write lock) before accessing data, blocking other transactions that need conflicting lock types.'),
('Can you explain the concept of dirty reads and how isolation prevents them', 'A dirty read occurs when a transaction reads data that has been written by another transaction but not yet committed. If the second transaction rolls back, the first transaction read data that never actually existed. Isolation levels like Read Committed and higher prevent dirty reads by ensuring transactions only read committed data.'),
('How do concurrency control techniques support isolation in ACID transactions', 'Concurrency control (like locking or MVCC) manages simultaneous access to data by multiple transactions, ensuring that despite interleaved execution, the final outcome is the same as if the transactions ran sequentially.'),
('Which isolation level is best for real-time data processing', 'It depends on the specific requirements. Read Committed is often a good balance, preventing dirty reads without excessive locking overhead. Snapshot Isolation (implemented via MVCC) can offer good performance and prevent more anomalies without extensive locking.'),
('How does snapshot isolation differ from traditional isolation levels', 'Traditional levels like Read Committed or Repeatable Read often rely on locking. Snapshot Isolation (MVCC) allows transactions to read a consistent snapshot of the database from when the transaction started, minimizing contention and preventing most anomalies without locking readers.'),

('How does snapshot isolation handle conflicts between transactions', 'If two transactions using snapshot isolation try to commit changes that conflict (they both modified the same data item based on their initial snapshots), one of them will typically fail (commit conflicts), requiring the application to retry the transaction.'),
('What are the performance benefits of using snapshot isolation', 'Snapshot isolation generally offers better performance and concurrency than locking-based strict isolation levels because readers do not block writers and writers do not block readers. Conflicts are detected at commit time rather than during execution.'),
('How does row versioning work in snapshot isolation', 'Instead of modifying data in place, updates create a new version of the row. Transactions read the version of the data that existed when they started, determined by timestamps or transaction IDs.'),
('Can snapshot isolation be used in all types of databases', 'No, it is primarily implemented in databases that use Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, and some NoSQL databases.'),
('What are the limitations of snapshot isolation', 'It doesn''t prevent all concurrency anomalies (e.g., write skew is possible). It requires sufficient storage for multiple data versions. Applications must handle commit conflicts by retrying transactions.'),
('How does consistent hashing handle node failures', 'When a node fails, the keys that were mapped to that node are redistributed to the remaining active nodes. Consistent hashing minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped, only affecting keys immediately adjacent to the failed node on the ring.'),
('What are the main advantages of consistent hashing over traditional hashing', 'Traditional hashing requires rehashing and redistributing almost all keys when the number of nodes changes.
